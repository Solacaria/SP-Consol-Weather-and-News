<H2>Why did you make this?</H2>
<p>This was an assignment for a school project. The objective was to get the API-key to work with the help of classes and then present the data.</p>
<p>To showcase my newly learned skills in C# and .NET frameworks. Learning to handle a project spread out into lots of files.</p>

<H2>Can i use your APIs?</H2>
<P>No. The APIs is free to get. Just click any of these and make a free account.</P>

<H2>Where do i put the API key?</H2>
